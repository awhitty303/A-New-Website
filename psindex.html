   <h2>I'M ALEX WHITBECK </h2>

    <p>My name is Alexander Whitbeck. I am 22 years old, and I live in Denver, Colorado. After graduating from Regis University in 2024, I found myself lost. I had a degree, but no real experience. What I decided was that the marketing field was one that looked for experience rather than passion, and I wasnt all that interested. This is why on August 1, 2025 I decided to sit down and create a twenty two week program to make me a developer, and enter into the tech world. I figured tech is the future, and something grand enough to commit your time to.</p>
